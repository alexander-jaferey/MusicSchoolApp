# MusicSchoolApp

MusicSchoolApp is an API and web application for managing and accessing course and instructor information for a music school. Instructors have a set of instruments they are proficient in, and courses are grouped by instrument and associated with instructors.

This application uses a Python/Flask backend written to PEP8 style guidelines to communicate with a PostgreSQL database, and a Next.js frontend. It integrates with Auth0 for authentication and authorization purposes.
