# MusicSchoolApp Frontend

## Getting Started

The MusicSchoolApp frontend is a Next.js frontend styled with TailwindCSS. The main dependencies are `node` and `npm`.

### Setup

In the frontend directory, copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your environment variables (see the [Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started) for information on how to set up an Auth0 account and application). Run `npm install` (only the first time) to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the frontend client in development mode at port 3000 on all available addresses.
